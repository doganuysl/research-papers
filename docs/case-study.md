## 2\. Analysis of Major Cyberattacks

This paper analyzes five major cyberattacks that have targeted Asian healthcare systems, focusing on the identification of vulnerabilities inherent in these systems. Through this analysis, the paper proposes the adoption of an Enriched Vulnerability Priority Score (EVPS) system. This system is designed to prioritize vulnerabilities effectively, enabling healthcare organizations in Asia to allocate resources efficiently towards mitigating the most critical cyber risks.

## 3\. Attack Vectors and Techniques

Attackers leverage a multitude of network protocols and services as attack vectors to exploit vulnerabilities within Asian healthcare systems, particularly targeting electronic health records (EHR) and sensitive patient data repositories. They employ sophisticated techniques to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, circumventing risk-based authentication schemes to hijack victim accounts and gain illicit access to critical systems. These techniques include phishing attacks, commonly used to trick users into revealing login credentials and bypassing authentication mechanisms, as well as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks that exploit critical vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and bypass authorization controls.

## 4\. Data Breach and Intrusion Techniques

Once inside the system, attackers breach data confidentiality by deploying various forms of malware, such as Trojan attacks and ransomware. For instance, the Orangeworm group's deployment of the Kwampirs Trojan compromised sensitive patient data in Singapore's SingHealth. Additionally, ransomware attacks like WannaCry, which exploited vulnerabilities in outdated operating systems, have affected hospitals in countries such as Japan, China, Indonesia, and Taiwan. These malicious software attacks compromise systems, granting unauthorized access to sensitive patient data stored in electronic health records (EHR) and critical resources, posing significant risks to patient privacy and healthcare security.

## 5\. Cybersecurity Policies and Procedures

Asian healthcare organizations often lack comprehensive cybersecurity policies and procedures compared to Western counterparts, with risk frameworks like the NIST framework proving effective in managing risks associated with healthcare data. These policies and procedures, when up-to-date and effectively implemented, help in controlling access to digital assets and providing awareness and training to personnel through technical and administrative security measures. However, comprehensive cybersecurity policies and procedures in the West, such as those seen in the United States, go beyond basic risk frameworks. They include security-related laws, policies, standards, and protective measures like the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), specifically designed to protect healthcare data. Western countries with higher cybersecurity maturity successfully employ these comprehensive frameworks to manage risks associated with healthcare data. For instance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) risk framework is extensively used to analyze cyberattacks on healthcare institutions in the West. It identifies vulnerabilities related to organizational governance and external dependencies at different tiers, providing a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks effectively.

## 6\. Vulnerability Management and Risk Assessment

Vulnerability management processes are crucial for identifying and treating security vulnerabilities in systems and software. Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk assessments enables organizations to allocate resources efficiently to mitigate high-risk threats. Additionally, vulnerability and risk self-assessment questionnaires significantly enhance cybersecurity awareness and training within Asian healthcare organizations, improving overall cybersecurity maturity. These processes involve identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities through techniques such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides best practices for vulnerability management in healthcare organizations, including the categorization of vulnerabilities into critical, high, medium, and low severity levels. Self-assessment survey instruments for vulnerability management serve as quick self-assessment tools in Asian healthcare IT organizations, aiding in the identification, evaluation, treatment, and reporting of security vulnerabilities in systems and software. Vulnerabilities in Asian healthcare systems are analyzed using the NIST risk framework to manage risks associated with healthcare data, introducing a vulnerability and threat pair concept to determine the likelihood of future adverse events in Asian healthcare IT systems.

## 7\. Incident Management and Response

Incident management and response plans play a vital role in cybersecurity resilience, allowing organizations to promptly detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. Employing self-assessment questionnaires as quick tools to understand cybersecurity maturity from a vulnerability and risk perspective can aid in developing robust incident management and response plans tailored to the organization's specific needs and risk profile.

## 8\. Implementation of Risk Frameworks and Best Practices

Asian healthcare organizations can significantly enhance their cybersecurity maturity by implementing risk frameworks such as ISO, NIST, and HIPAA, which provide comprehensive guidelines and best practices for managing cyber risks effectively. These frameworks offer a structured approach to cybersecurity risk management, including guidelines for vulnerability management processes such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. By utilizing these techniques, organizations can identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in their systems and prioritize risk-reducing controls recommended by cybersecurity risk management journals. Additionally, self-assessment survey instruments for vulnerability management serve as quick self-assessment tools in Asian healthcare IT organizations, aiding in the identification and mitigation of security risks.

## 9\. Strategies for Preventing Incident Recurrence

To prevent incident recurrence and establish robust cybersecurity programs, organizations can implement several key strategies.

Firstly, conducting regular cybersecurity risk assessments is essential. This involves thoroughly evaluating the organization's IT infrastructure, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and assessing the severity of each risk. By prioritizing vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood, organizations can allocate resources more effectively to address the most critical security gaps. Utilizing advanced vulnerability scanning tools and techniques, such as automated vulnerability scanners and penetration testing, can greatly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of these risk assessments, increasing the likelihood of identifying and mitigating high-risk vulnerabilities successfully.

Secondly, developing customized incident management and response plans is crucial. These plans should be tailored to the organization's specific needs, considering factors like the types of cyber threats commonly faced, the criticality of IT systems and data, and the available resources for incident response. Self-assessment questionnaires can be valuable tools in this process, helping organizations evaluate their readiness to handle various types of cyber incidents and refine their response strategies accordingly. Additionally, leveraging risk analysis frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or ISO 27001 can provide structured guidance for developing comprehensive incident response plans that align with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

Furthermore, implementing alternative approaches such as threat intelligence sharing can significantly enhance an organization's cybersecurity posture. By collaborating with industry peers, sharing threat intelligence, and staying informed about emerging cyber threats and attack trends, organizations can proactively identify potential risks and take preemptive measures to mitigate them. Continuous monitoring of IT systems and networks using advanced security monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions can also play a crucial role in detecting and responding to security incidents in real time.

Finally, regular security audits and assessments are essential for ensuring ongoing compliance with security policies, standards, and regulations. Conducting comprehensive security audits, including internal and external audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments, can help identify weaknesses in the cybersecurity infrastructure and processes. Organizations should prioritize addressing audit findings and implementing corrective actions promptly to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses and minimize the risk of future incidents.

By incorporating these strategies into their cybersecurity programs, organizations can build a proactive and resilient cybersecurity posture, effectively mitigating cyber threats and reducing the likelihood of incident recurrence.
